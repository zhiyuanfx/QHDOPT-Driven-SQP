# Quantum vs. Classical Driven SQP Analyzer

This project provides an analytical comparison between Quantum Driven Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Classical Driven SQP. The aim is to evaluate whether quantum computing can offer better quality solutions and faster convergence times than traditional classical computing methods.

## Features

- Implementation of Classical SQP and Quantum SQP algorithms.
- Tools to compare performance, including solution quality and computational time.
- A framework for running experiments across a range of test problems.
